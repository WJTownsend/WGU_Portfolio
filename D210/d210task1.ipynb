    "## A1: Dashboard, Data Sources, and Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "The dashboard containing my data analysis is [published at Tableau Public for general consumption](https://public.tableau.com/shared/P4D66FQQH?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). This is the easiest way to provide the interactive dashboard to any user, as it avoids the necessity for installation of Tableau or another program, while preserving the usability of the presentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This data analysis makes use of two datasets:\n",
    "- The WGU medical dataset, provided by WGU for several of the classes in the MSDA program.\n",
    "- [The 2013-14 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), provided by the United States Centers of Disease Control & Prevention.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/national-health-and-nutrition-examination-survey) \n",
    "\n",
    "The WGU medical dataset is, despite its title, not very well cleaned up for usage in data analysis. I used code from my prior projects [(D208)](https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=9ac55b7b-f61e-46da-bc56-af5c0034f1d7) [(D209)](https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f273f038-af83-4566-8331-af60017c5ba8) to prepare this data for use in this data analysis, with some minor modifications. \n",
    "\n",
    "The NHANES dataset is extremely unwieldy and needed to be trimmed for me to be able to work with it easily. While it is only 10,175 rows long, the dataset consists of hundreds of columns across several different CSV files, the vast majority of which I had no use for. I ended up choosing a selection of columns from the NHANES data regarding survey participants' demographic information and medical diagnoses, for which I had comparable data in the WGU dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to whittling down the NHANES dataset from hundreds of columns to only those I was interested in comparing to the WGU dataset, I also had to do some cleaning/standardizing of the NHANES dataset. The NHANES dataset columns are encoded in such a way that they are not intuitive, and many of the values for each column of interest were also not intuitive. For example, the NHANES survey encodes gender as \"1\" and \"2\" rather than \"Male\" and \"Female\". The CDC provides data dictionaries for decoding the variable names for each column in both [the demographic section of the survey](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Search/variablelist.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013) as well as [the medical questionnaire section of the survey](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Search/variablelist.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&CycleBeginYear=2013). [Human-readable translations of column values were provided by the CDC](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&CycleBeginYear=2013) as well. These resources were used to prepare the NHANES dataset to be analyzed. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important note here is the diverging handling of ages in the NHANES and WGU datasets. The NHANES dataset top-codes age at 80 years, so any survey participant over the age of 80 was instead counted as being age 80. The WGU dataset includes patients beyond age 80, and does not top code them. To help provide an apples-to-apples comparison, I top-coded the WGU dataset's age column to 80 years old. This retained these observations, while making sure that it could be equitably compared to the NHANES data. A similar issue existed at the low end of the age range, as the NHANES dataset includes survey participants under the age of 18, while the WGU dataset omits patients under the age of 18. Again, an adjustment was necessary to ensure an equitable comparison between the datasets, so I omitted the NHANES data for any patient under the age of 18. This reduced the NHANES dataset to around 6600 observations from 10,175. As a result of this, the WGU dataset is approximately 150% larger than the reduced NHANES dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "One other thing to highlight about the datasets and my presentation of them is my discussion of the \"WGU Hospital System\". The WGU medical dataset doesn't ascribe these statistics to anything except for a vague \"hospital system\" for which I am a data analyst. It was awkward to keep ascribing these to a dataset or to \"the\" hospital system, so I settled on just declaring it to be the \"WGU Hospital System\". WGU now runs both online schools and a national hospital system. \n",
    "\n",
    "While there is no particular requirement outlined in this project's rubric that I provide the code used to prepare my datasets for analysis (nor demonstrate that my code works in my Panopto video), this has been a requirement for every other course in this program. As a result, I have provided my code here, in case it is of interest to the evaluator. If not, it may be skipped. Similarly, the execution of this code will be included in my Panopto video. That code will also generate the datasets that I am required by the rubric to provide for this project. \"final_medical_clean.csv\" is the prepared WGU dataset, and \"final_NHANES_clean.csv\" is the prepared NHANES dataset. Both CSV files have been provided alongside this report. "

    "## A2: Dashboard Installation Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "No \"installation\" of any kind is necessary. Users (or evaluators) can [access the dashboard by simply opening this link](https://public.tableau.com/shared/P4D66FQQH?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) in a modern web browser, such as Google Chrome. This makes the dashboard more universally accessible, as complicated technical directions or expensive programs are not necessary to use the dashboard, whether one is interested in following the story that I present or instead using the dashboard to glean their own insights into the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='PartA3'></a>\n",
    "## A3: Dashboard Navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigation and use of the dashboard on Tableau Public is very easy. [Open this link in a web browser to access the story](https://public.tableau.com/shared/P4D66FQQH?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). The four boxes at the top of the story can be thought of as \"tabs\" like you might find in your web browser. The \"Intro\" tab provides a very brief introduction of the presentation and myself, and as such, is non-interactable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Who Are Our Patients?\" tab is an interactable dashboard that provides visualizations about the WGU Hospital System's patient demographics, such as patient age, number of children, or gender. This data can be filtered in multiple ways. In the bottom right of this dashboard are filters for both age and gender. By adjusting the age slider, the user can change the range of ages reported. For example, setting the slider to 40 - 50 will show the distribution of patients aged 40 - 50, the number of children for patients aged 40 - 50, and the genders of patients aged 40 - 50. Similarly, clicking on any gender in the gender filter (which also functions as a legend) will update all of the visualizations to reflect only the selected gender. Alternatively, clicking on a portion of the visualization will filter in the same way. For example, clicking on the \"male\" portion of the pie charts visualizing patient gender will update all data in the dashboard to reflect only male patients, similar to using the filter in the bottom right. Clicking on the \"male\" portion of the pie chart (or on \"Male\" in the filter) will \"release\" this filter and return the visualizations to the original view. \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Condition KPIs\" tab is another interactable dashboard, providing visualizations and data about selected serious medical conditions observed in both the CDC NHANES dataset and the WGU dataset. The rate of diagnosis for each medical condition is provided as a key performance indicator (KPI), demonstrating how many patients amongst both the WGU and CDC datasets have this condition. This is further broken down in the heatmap to the right of each KPI, demonstrating the raw count of patients with that diagnosis by age group, for both the CDC and WGU datasets. For reference, the WGU dataset has approximately 150% more observations than the CDC's NHANES data (~10,000 rows vs 6,600), as detailed above in section A1. The same filters for age and gender are provided in the top right of this dashboard, and they are used in the same fashion as they were in the previous dashboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"To Go Box\" tab of the dashboard contains the key observations that I made in this data analysis, as well as the recommended actions for the WGU Hospital System to implement going forward. These are also non-interactable. Ideally, I would not provide them in such a fashion, but they are required to be present in the presentation by the project rubric, so I have provided them to account for that requirement. \n",

    "## B: Panopto Recording of Data Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Panopto recording of my presentation can be found here](https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=632642ef-67cc-4344-a457-af740000667e).\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='PartC1'></a>\n",
    "## C1: Dashboard Alignment with Needs\n",
    "\n",
    "The WGU medical data dictionary describes a particular interest in predicting readmission of patients who have been previously hospitalized, but it does not preclude examination of other trends or alternative insights. The direction I took with this data analysis was rather broad in scope, avoiding looking at readmission in particular and instead looking at demographic and medical condition trends for the patients in the WGU Hospital System. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two dashboards that I generated for this data analysis help to provide additional information which could then be used for a variety of purposes by the WGU Hospital System. The first allows for insights regarding the demographics of WGU Hospital System patients, specifically regarding age, number of children, and gender. An example of an insight gained from this dashboard is the comparison to the CDC's NHANES data which indicates that the WGU Hospital System serves many more older patients than would be expected from the NHANES data. This can inform decisions such as whether limited resources should be allocated towards expanding pediatric care or geriatric care and related concerns. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second dashboard examines a subset of serious patient health conditions: diabetes, high blood pressure, and hyperlipidemia. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are generated to demonstrate the rates of each of these diseases amongst both WGU patients and NHANES survey participants. This context allows the executive board of the WGU Hospital System to evaluate the success of current initiatives aimed at prevention or reduction of certain diseases/conditions by giving a point of comparison, or to determine where conditions merit such initiatives in the future. An example of an insight gained from this dashboard is the dramatically higher rate of diabetes diagnoses in WGU Hospital System patients compared to the diabetic rates of NHANES participants. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this data analysis doesn't *directly* address the chief concern of the hospital system regarding readmission rates of previously hospitalized patients, it does give the opportunity for additional insights which can improve our understanding of our patients and their healthcare issues. This is directly relevant to the hospital's mission of improving the health and quality of life of our patients, and improving patient outcomes through such efforts is intuitively likely to result in secondary improvements to the WGU Hospital System's readmission rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='PartC2'></a>\n",
    "## C2: Justification of Additional Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "The data presented in the WGU medical dataset is devoid of context, especially where the patient healthcare information is concerned. I can examine the data to see how many patients in the dataset have asthma or diabetes or have had a stroke, but there's no context to indicate if those rates are low, normal, or high. That context would be useful to help the hospital system in many ways - it could indicate where resources ought to be spent in future budget years, it could lead to intervention where the system is failing patients with one condition compared to another, or it could help the system anticipate trends in patient medical data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [2013-14 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey generated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/national-health-and-nutrition-examination-survey) uses both physical examinations and interviews with survey participants to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children throughout the United States. NHANES specifically examines a nationally representative sample of people across the country. When I was searching for datasets on Kaggle that I could relate to the WGU medical data, this dataset immediately stood out as one that could help offer this context that was missing from the original data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In examining the hundreds of variables in the NHANES data, I ended up selecting the variables that had clear, direct analogues in the WGU dataset:\n",
    "- Participant age\n",
    "- Participant gender\n",
    "- Participant's number of children\n",
    "- Participant diagnosis: Arthritis\n",
    "- Participant diagnosis: Asthma\n",
    "- Participant diagnosis: Diabetes\n",
    "- Participant diagnosis: High Blood Pressure\n",
    "- Participant diagnosis: Hyperlipidemia\n",
    "- Participant diagnosis: Overweight\n",
    "- Participant diagnosis: Stroke\n",
    "\n",
    "By having data for these conditions which is representative of the US population, this provides a point of comparison for analyzing the WGU medical dataset. For example, I can compare the rate at which NHANES participants are diagnosed with diabetes to the rate at which patients in the WGU medical dataset are diagnosed with diabetes. In that particular example, I found that where only 11.88% of adults aged 18-80 in the NHANES dataset were diabetic, while a startling 27.38% of adults in the WGU dataset were diabetic. That is a striking difference, and its one that could significantly inform decisions within the hospital system regarding allocation of resources to address this issue or evaluation of current processes & resources in this area. While that 27.38% diabetic rate was previously visible in the WGU dataset, it wasn't apparent if this was \"good\", \"bad\", or \"as expected\". The NHANES dataset provided context to realize that the rate of diabetes in patients of the WGU hospital data is alarmingly high. This context allows for similar conclusions regarding both demographic data and other healthcare conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='PartC3'></a>\n",
    "## C3: Explanation of Data Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different data visualizations in the provided dashboard. One visualization which is used multiple times is the heatmaps of each of the serious health conditions tracked in the Condition KPIs dashboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "In these visualizations, patients are broken down into groups by age, from age 15 - 19 (the dataset only includes patients aged 18 or older), 20-24, 25-29,... 75-79, and then age 80+. For both the NHANES (CDC) and WGU datasets, the count of patients diagnosed with that condition is then displayed for each of those age groups. The heatmap is then shaded in based upon those values, with darker colors indicating a larger number of patients diagnosed with that condition (diabetes, high blood pressure, or hyperlipidemia). While the KPI provided on the left side of the dashboard indicates an overall rate of positive diagnoses, this allows the executive board or other users to see exactly where (by age) within the patient population that the number of diagnoses is diverging from other data. If the WGU dataset and the CDC dataset had the same rate of a condition, then we'd expect to see consistent differences between the two datasets at each age group for that condition (the WGU dataset is ~50% larger than the reduced NHANES dataset, so the WGU counts would be expected to be 50% higher than the NHANES counts, in this example). If the WGU Hospital System has a higher (or lower) rate for a given condition, then looking in the age groups can reveal if that change is evident in one group of patients or another, such as males vs females or younger patients vs older, or even a combination thereof. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Who Are Our Patients? dashboard contains a visualization with ages of WGU patients and NHANES survey participants. Ages are broken down into groups of 2 years (18-19, 20-21, 22-23,... 78-79, 80+). Each bar's length shows the number of patients in that 2-year age group. This allows users to see the distribution of patients in the WGU system and the NHANES data by age, allowing comparison of the two. This can be used to determine if one dataset or the other contains more younger (or older) people. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specific data can be found by moving the mouse cursor over the data of interest. A tooltip will appear, which will describe the particular statistic that the mouse is pointing to. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='PartC4'></a>\n",
    "## C4: Explanation of Interactive Controls\n",
    "\n",
    "The above visualizations, along with all other visualizations provided on both dashboards, are able to be filtered by using either (or both) the provided age filter and gender filter. Adjusting the age slider restricts the presentation of data to patients within the selected age range. Clicking on a given gender in the gender filter restricts the presentation of data to patients of the selected gender type. These filters allow for a more detailed look at the data, such as seeing the distribution of ages of male patients in particular, or the rate of hyperlipidemia in patients age 40 - 60. These two filters can even be used in conjunction with each other, such as to view the number of children for female patients in particular, aged 20 - 50. Through this filtering, users can easily look at specific trends within the data without having to request new visualizations be generated by the data analyst. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, each visualization is interactable to be used for filtering and highlighting as well. For example, clicking on the Non Binary portion of the Gender visualization will adjust all of the visualizations in the dashboard to reflect only the non-binary patients, similarly to selecting this gender in the gender filter. Clicking on this item a second time will undo this action. This action can be used as a means to filter for other things which a filter is not readily provided, such as adjusting the visualization to reflect patients with 4 children, by clicking on the bar in the Number of Children visualization which represents patients with 4 children. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='PartC5'></a>\n",
    "## C5: Colorblindness & Accessibility\n",
    "\n",
    "I used [this discussion of color palettes and colorblindness at VennGage](https://venngage.com/blog/color-blind-friendly-palette/) to inform my use of colors within the data analysis. The vast majority (99%) of people with colorblindness suffer from red/green colorblindness of one kind or another, so I avoided using this combination of colors. Using the color wheels provided by VennGage, I settled on Blue, Pink, and Yellow as representations for Male, Female, and Nonbinary genders, respectively. A user with red/green colorblindness would likely perceive these colors as Blue, Brown, and Yellow, so the color palette should remain viable for this user. Clear labels on the provided filters should provide support for users with the other forms of colorblindness, which are fortunately extremely rare. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='PartC6'></a>\n",
    "## C6: Data Representations & Data Story\n",
    "\n",
    "Two data visualizations that support the story that I wanted to present in my data analysis are the age visualization and the diabetes KPI. \n",
    "\n",
    "When I began exploring the combined WGU and NHANES dataset, one of the things that immediately stuck out to me was how different the WGU Hospital System patients are from the representative sample provided in the NHANES dataset. The difference in ages was one of the most striking differences, and I feel that this bar graph really communicates that difference effectively. The WGU Hospital System data omits minors and does not top code age, while the NHANES data initially did include minors (I omitted this data) and top codes anyone over the age of 80 as being age 80. The representation of number of patients at each 2-year age group really underlines how the WGU Hospital System has vastly more elderly patients (age 80 or older, top coded as age 80). This is a useful observation because knowing that the patient population is dramatically older can inform future resource allocation or targetted initiatives. For example, the WGU dataset doesn't address dementia in any way, but knowing that an outsized portion of the patient population is over the age of 80, this would be a good thing to investigate further or to invest resources into addressing with our patients. \n",
    "\n",
    "When I found the NHANES dataset, I knew that one of the things that I wanted to do was use this to provide a point of reference for whether certain levels of serious diseases were high or low within the WGU dataset. If 25% of patients have a given disease, that might seem high to me, but without a frame of reference, that would just be a guess on my part. This led to developing a batch of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for a selection of serious diseases in the dashboard. The diabetes one in particular stood out as being the most concerning one, because the rate of diabetes in the WGU Hospital System was more than twice what it was in the NHANES data, which is supposed to be representative of the USA at large. While there may be explanations for this (NHANES represents the USA as a whole, not people hospitalized within the USA), the magnitude of the difference was concerning and seems a good opportunity for further action. The related heatmaps help provide a little more context to these KPIs by demonstrating where within the patient population the number of diabetic patients is significantly larger, but the KPI by itself is a really clear and direct tool for communicating how the difference in diabetic rates between these two groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='PartC7'></a>\n",
    "## C7: Audience Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The WGU data dictionary stipulates that my presentation is to an executive board, which is generally interested in broad conclusions. In particular, it noted that I was presenting to the Vice President of Research and the Senior Vice President of Hospital Operations. The conclusion regarding the pattern of dramatically higher diabetes rates amongst WGU Hospital System patients is somewhat limited, in that I lack both domain knowledge and additional data which might explain why this is the case. The Vice President of Research would be interested in things which fall into their scope of authority, and the sort of multidisciplinary research that would need to be performed to both determine why this is the case and what to do about it would likely be directly within their wheelhouse. The conclusions about the overall demographics of WGU Hospital System patients would be of particular import to the Senior Vice President of Hospital Operations, given that they have a responsibility for the operation of the hospitals, including resource allocation, strategic planning, and initiatives regarding patient outcomes. They would obviously have some interest in the research needed to address the issues with diabetic rates amongst the patient population, but the more direct and immediate interest would be in the demographics of their hospital patients and how this impacts both patient treatment and operations of the hospitals in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='PartC8'></a>\n",
    "## C8: Universal Access\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from the considerations described in section C5 for colorblind users, this data analysis is also universally accessible by other users. The provision of the analysis on Tableau Public increases accessibility by making the analysis accessible to anyone with a web browser, rather than requiring expensive software licenses or complex technical directions for installing a program to handle such visualizations. I provided alt text for the image that I used in my presentation, so that visually impaired users can experience the image through the use of assistive technology. Additionally, the recorded Panopto presentation includes an audio component in my narration of the presentation, which provides some accessibility for users with visual impairment. Users who are deaf or hard of hearing can access the presentation visually through exploring it and reading my conclusions in the final slide. \n",

While my data analysis was somewhat simple, I used narrative throughout my presentation to tell a story focused on two main conclusions that I wanted the reader to take away from my work: the discrepancies between the patient population versus the representative sample of the USA as a whole, and the dramatically increased rate of diabetes within the patient population compared to the NHANES data. The narrative of my presentation emphasized these points, to help the audience follow the story to the intended conclusion. I also used visuals in my storytelling, creating several different representations of data that would be approachable and intuitive to the user without being overly complex. In fact, multiple data visualizations were provided for the primary points of my presentation, which was both required by the project rubric and served to help support the narrative of the story. These elements assisted in providing an effective data story for the executive board of the WGU Hospital System in my presentation. \n",
