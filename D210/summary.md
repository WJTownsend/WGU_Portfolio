# D210: Representation & Reporting

## Course Summary

WGU states that D210 Representation and Reporting focuses on communicating observations and patterns to diverse stakeholders, a key aspect of the data analytics life cycle. This course helps students gain communication and storytelling skills. It also covers data visualizations, audio representations, and interactive dashboards.

This course has one Practical Assessment. 

## Course Objectives

WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Data Visualization:** The graduate creates data representations to offer insight into an organizational problem.
- **Business Intelligence:** The graduate communicates data insights to technical and nontechnical audiences.
- **Executive Dashboards:** The graduate designs executive decision support with interactive tools.

## Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files

This course has one Practical Assessment. 

This project requires the student to use one of the two provided datasets (medical or churn) and an additional external dataset of their own choosing to generate a series of data visualizations about the two datasets. These visualizations are developed in Tableau, a Business Intelligence tool, to generate interactive dashboards with filtering capability. The student then gives a presentation of these finished dashboards to an executive board for their chosen dataset (medical or churn) with Business Intelligence and insights generated from *both* datasets. 

For this project, I used the [Centers for Disease Control's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/national-health-and-nutrition-examination-survey) as my external dataset. This provided a nationally representative point of comparison for the WGU medical data, allowing for some conclusions to be drawn about the population of the hypothetical WGU Hospital System. This allowed me to generate a number of insights about the patient population of this hospital system and develop Key Performance Indicators.[My report for this project, including all of my Python code, can be viewed here.](d210task1.ipynb) [The interactive dashboard that I created for this assignment is hosted on Tableau Public and can be viewed here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/william.townsend5052/viz/shared/P4D66FQQH)

This task required a video presentation, simulated as a presentation to the executive board to demonstrate the function of the dashboards and provide the insights mentioned above. After performing this presentation, I also included a demonstration of the successful operation of all code included in my report.
