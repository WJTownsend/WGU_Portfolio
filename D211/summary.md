## Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files

This course has one Practical Assessment. 

This project is largely identical to the previous project, in its requirement to use both a provided dataset and an external one of the student's selection to generate Business Intelligence to be presented to an executive board. The primary differences between the prior course and this one are that this is performed on a virtual machine, where the external dataset must be incorporated into an existing PostgreSQL database using pgAdmin. This requires that all data cleaning and preparations are performed in SQL, rather than Python/R. A database connection is then generated in Tableau to create a permanent connection that allows the student's dashboards to update whenever the database is updated. 

For this project, I used the same external dataset, the [Centers for Disease Control's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/national-health-and-nutrition-examination-survey). I generated the same dashboards, insights, and observations as I did on the prior assignment. The difference for this class was that all data importing, cleaning, and joining was done in SQL, rather than Python. [My report for this project, including all of my SQL coding, can be viewed here.](d211task1.docx) [The interactive dashboard that I created for this assignment is hosted on Tableau Public and can be viewed here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/william.townsend5052/viz/shared/P4D66FQQH)

This task required a video presentation, though this had slightly different requirements than the previous class' video in that it required a brief presentation of the generated dashboards and then focused on the use of SQL throughout the project.
