# D204: The Data Analytics Journey

## Course Summary

D204 is the first class of WGU's MSDA program, and it largely represents a review of many concepts that were core to the BSDMDA program that precedes it. It is the only class in the MSDA that uses an Objective Assessment (final exam) format rather than a Practical Assessment (project) format to complete the course. This is also the only class in the MSDA that does not use DataCamp as its primary course material, using WGU's own course materials instead. 

## Course Objectives

WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **The Data Analytics Life Cycle:** The graduate explains the phases of the data analytics life cycle to contextualize and define the scope of each phase.
- **Organizational Needs:** The graduate determines organizational requirements to improve key drivers.
- **Project Planning:** The graduate develops a project plan to solve organizational problems.
- **Data Analytics Tools & Techniques:** The graduate identifies appropriate data analytics tools and techniques to solve organizational problems.

## Course Materials

This course uses WGU's own course materials, accessible only to WGU students. 

## Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files

As there is no practical assessment for this course, there are no reports, videos, or other files to link to here. I did pass the Objective Assessment with a score of 88%.
