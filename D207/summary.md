# D207: Exploratory Data Analysis

## Course Summary

WGU states that D207 Exploratory Data Analysis covers statistical principles supporting the data analytics life cycle. Students in this course compute and interpret measures of central tendency, correlations, and variation. The course introduces hypothesis testing, focusing on application for parametric tests, and addresses communication skills and tools to explain an analystâ€™s findings to others within an organization.

This course has one Practical Assessment. 

## Course Objectives

WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Data Interpretation:** The graduate interprets central tendency, correlations, and variation to inform organizational decisions.
- **Conducting Parametric Testing:** The graduate conducts parametric hypothesis testing.

## Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files

This course has a single Practical Assessment. This project requires the student to use one of the provided datasets (medical or churn) and develop a research question to be analyzed by using one of chi-square, t-test, or ANOVA techniques to test a hypothesis relating to that research question. The student must also develop a number of univariate and bivariate statistics describing variables in the dataset. 

My research question for this project was very similar to my question from preceding projects, *"Do patients with chronic back pain have a higher rate of readmission than the rest of the population?"* I used a chi-square test for independence to check readmission rates for patients with chronic back pain vs without, which returned a p-value of 0.19. As a result, the null hypothesis was confirmed. [My report for this project, including all of my Python code, can be viewed here.](d207task1.ipynb)

This task required a video presentation, demonstrating the successful operation of all code included in my report and covering certain aspects of the report. [That video can be seen here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19EeTuEbvrGgWH0xJl8LSu_j8HXFRjSYr/view?usp=share_link).
