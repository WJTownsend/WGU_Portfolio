    "## A1: Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "The research question that I want to examine is, \"Can a decision tree model using a boost method be used to identify patients with chronic back pain from the provided data?\" In D208 Task 2 (Logistic Regression) and D209 Task 1 (K-Nearest Neighbors Classification, or KNN) I attempted very similar research questions, attempting to generate models to correctly identify or predict patients to have diagnosed chronic back pain. As such, this project will be borrowing heavily from my submission for both of these Performance Assessments, especially in the area of data preparation. \n",

    "<a id=\"#PartA2\"></a>\n",
    "## A2: Objectives and Goals of Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, I've attempted to look for a way to predict back pain diagnoses in my prior two Performance Assessments. I've been frustrated with the results, but with D209 Task 2 providing me another option for a classification model by using decision trees, I personally wanted to see if I couldn't improve on that prior work to develop something better. The goal of this analysis is to build a prediction model that exceeds the prior models, with an accuracy of 0.58 and an AUC (Area Under the Curve) score of 0.52. This is a worthwhile business goal for the hospital system because identification of patients with or likely to have chronic back pain offers insight into the individual's healthcare situation, including managing their current health issues and mitigating risks for new issues. The management of those current issues or mitigation of potential future issues is precisely the business of the hospital, and proactive and effective management of those concerns can help lead to better outcomes for currently hospitalized patients, while preventing tomorrow's issues, such as a patient's current hospitalization being extended, being re-hospitalized for the same issue, or even avoiding a future hospitalization for a potential complication or health risk which was avoided.\n",

    "## B1: Justification of Classification Method\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree works by creating a tree which consists of nodes that ask a question of the data needing to be labelled, where that question has only two possible answers. Based on the answer to that question, the data then follows a path down the tree to either the right or left to a new node, which asks another question and then again routes the datapoint to the left or right again. This process continues until an ending is reached, called a leaf, which applies a label based upon how the questions were answered. In this case, we're asking a series of questions like \"is this datapoints age greater than the mean age of the dataset?\", and when we get to the end of the decision tree and reach a leaf, that leaf will provide a prediction of either 0 (patient does not have chronic back pain) or 1 (patient does have chronic back pain). \n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree provides another means to classify data into one label or another, much like KNN classification did in my prior project. Decision trees can fit the data more effectively than a linear model may, because a plot of all of the data involved can contain multiple decision-regions labelled as either \"1\" or \"0\". As it relates to KNN, a decision tree does not need to be scaled, is not sensitive to outliers, and can handle imbalanced data [(Milena Afeworki @ Towards Data Science, 2021)](https://milena-pa.medium.com/a-comparison-of-machine-learning-algorithms-knn-vs-decision-trees-d6110e08bfea). The decision tree provides an alternative classification model that does not depend upon clustering in the same way as KNN, so it may provide different results. Especially with the ability to boost my decision tree using a method such as Adaboost, an opportunity exists to generate several models, with each one getting to learn from its predecessors. If there is any possibility to perform this classification task that I've been working on for several projects now, I'm hopeful that a boosted decision tree will be able to do so. \n",

    "## B2: Assumptions of a Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees make relatively few assumptions about their data, compared to other predictive models. However, decision trees do make an implicit assumption that simple relationships exist amongst the explanatory and response variables, rather than complex ones. The step-wise nature of a decision tree's work to analyze a datapoint, working downward through nodes at which only two possibilities exist (left or right) means that there are complex relationships between variables that a decision tree cannot learn or account for. \n",

    "I will be using Python throughout this analysis project. Python is a programming language that supports data science processes very well, particularly in the use of packages designed specifically for this. Python also happens to be the only programming language that I know to any sort of significant degree. I'll also be using several Python packages to perform this analysis:\n",
    "- pandas allows for the handling of the dataset in something like a large table or spreadsheet\n",
    "  - pandas' CategoricalDtype lets me create columns which are categorical *and* ordinal in nature\n",
    "- NumPy allows for performing certain mathematical operations or assignment of certain values within the dataset\n",
    "- Seaborn and MatPlotLib provide graphing functionality\n",
    "- sklearn also provides several functions that are required components for this analysis\n",
    "  - The train_test_split function allows us to easily break up our dataset into training and testing portions\n",
    "  - DecisionTreeClassifier is the basis of this model, which we will use to classify patients into 1 (back pain) or 0 (none)\n",
    "  - AdaBoostClassifier is an ensemble method to improve classifier performance\n",
    "  - GridSearchCV will be used for hyperparameter tuning of the DecisionTreeClassifier\n",
    "  - The confusion_matrix function will let me print a confusion matrix for the classification model\n",
    "  - roc_auc_score function will compute the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score for the classification model\n",
    "  - roc_curve will allow for plotting the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of the classification model\n",
    "  - classification_report provides an easy summary report of the metrics for the classification model\n",
    "  - accuracy_score gives an easy way to calculate the accuracy of our model\n",
    "  - mean_squared_error is another method for evaluating our model, and it is required by the rubric"

    "While there are several data preparation and cleaning steps that are going to be necessary here, one of them that will have to be performed for decision tree classification is one hot encoding. One hot encoding represents categorical data by placing it into columns with integer values of 1 or 0 to communicate the same information in a numeric fashion. For example, the gender column contains values for Female, Male, and Nonbinary. Two columns can be created which will actually communicate the same information. If a 1 appears in the first column, then the patient is male. If a 1 appears in the second column, then the patient is nonbinary. If a 1 appears in neither column (both 0), then the patient is female. This can easily be done by using pandas' `get_dummies()` function. \n",

    "To generate a decision tree classification model using the `DecisionTreeClassifier` model, I have to determine the best parameters to use, particularly with the `max_depth` and `min_samples_leaf` fields. Maximum depth describes how many levels I will allow the tree to grow to. Greater depth means greater complexity, but this can also cause overfitting of the model. Minimum samples per leaf dictates how leaf nodes can be split up, requiring a certain portion of samples to be remaining on both the left and right sides of a node. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, I'll instantiate an initial DecisionTreeClassifier, as well as a list of possible values for these parameters. I'll then use a GridSearch to implement this initial decision tree model, testing it with each of the parameters that I've provided. The GridSearch will determine the performance of each possible permutation of the decision tree model, settling on a set of parameters which provide the best performance. I will print the accuracy and AUC score for this model, as a point of reference for further refinement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the GridSearch has finished tuning the hyperparameters for the model, I will generate a instance of DecisionTreeClassifier, using those parameters. I want to use Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoosting) to further improve the resulting decision tree, but this requires me to create an initial decision tree to use in the first place. Creating the best decision tree possible for this data through hyperparameter tuning will provide a more effective model for AdaBoosting to improve upon. "

I'll use hyperparameter tuning with GridSearch CV again to determine the appropriate values for both the number of estimators, and the learning rate to create the most successful model by AUC score.\n",

    "## E1: Accuracy of Classification Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire reason that I wanted to construct this model is because the logistic regression model I'd created in D208 and the KNN classification model I'd created in D209 were only accurate to about 58-59%. These models achieved this accuracy by leaning heavily (or entirely) to predicting patients to not have back pain (label = 0), which was accurate for 58.86% of observations in the dataset. As a result, these models lacked precision, having difficulty correctly predicting instances where the patient did have back pain (label = 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "This model was significantly more accurate than the prior models, finishing with an accuracy of 0.74. This is most evident by looking at the confusion matrix. We can see that the model was correct on 1480 (954 + 526) occasions out of 2000 observations in the test set, while being incorrect on 520 (297 + 223). This model was not \"afraid\" to predict patients to have back pain, unlike my prior two models, and it actually did so at a reasonably effective rate. This model had a precision of 0.70, which is a significant improvement over the KNN classifier's precision of just 0.47. \n",
    "\n",
    "The mean squared error (MSE) of this classification model is 0.26. Mean squared error is the average of the square of the errors in the model, errors being the difference between the actual values and the estimated values. A lower MSE is better, at is it indicates that the magnitude of the errors (which it proceeds to square and then average) are smaller in magnitude. It is worth noting, however, that MSE is not a good choice for evaluating a binary classification problem such as this one for two primary reasons, as explained by [Rafay Khan for Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-using-mean-squared-error-mse-cost-function-for-binary-classification-is-a-bad-idea-933089e90df7). First, an MSE assumes a normal distribution, where a binary dataset is not a normal distribution. Second, an MSE expects inputs from negative infinity to positive infinity, while a binary model outputs only 0 and 1. Despite this, I have provided the mean squared error for this model because the rubric requires it. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"#PartE2\"></a>\n",
    "## E2: Model Results\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained above, this model has a much higher accuracy than the prior ones that I created, and it also has a much higher AUC score. A good way to visualize the effectiveness of this model is with a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve."

    "On this graph, the center diagonal line represents classification performance if done completely randomly (50%). A classifier's performance can be plotted onto this graph, with a curve below the diagonal reflecting a poor prediction rate (all the way to 0% correct predictions in the bottom right) while a curve above the diagonal reflects a good prediction rate (all the way up to 100% correct predictions in the top left). The Area Under the Curve (AUC) score is the percentage of the graph's area that is beneath the curve created by the classification model, where a perfect (100% correct) model would have an AUC of 1.0 and a completely wrong (0% correct) model would have an AUC of 0.0. This model has an AUC of 0.80. For reference, the KNN model that I created in Task 1 for D209 had an AUC score of only 0.52. \n",
    "\n",
    "This model is not perfect, but it is clearly much more effective than completely random classification is. In this regard, this project has met its goal of outperforming the models that preceded it. There is still room for improvement, but this model could provide some use to patients and the hospital system at large.  \n",

    "## E3: Classification Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important limitation of this analysis is that the 10,000 observations on which the model is built are not really that many, relative to the overall population of people hospitalized in the United States. There is a core assumption to any sort of predictive modeling that the sample is representative of the population, and it is not clear that the data provided here is actually representative of the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is important, because this model is built upon decision trees, which have used adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) to increase the performance of the model. Decision trees themselves are unstable, because changes in the data values can result in a new tree being constructed, which may lead to different outcomes as each datapoint traverses the tree [(Corporate Finance Institute, 2022)](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/data-science/decision-tree/). While this is addressed somewhat through the use of AdaBoosting, AdaBoosting itself requires a quality dataset, which requires avoiding noisy data [(Analytics Vidyha, 2021)](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/adaboost-a-brief-introduction-to-ensemble-learning/). Prior exploration of this dataset in previous classes gave some indications that it was rather noisy, especially because of the data being extremely unfocused between census data, very specific healthcare data, financial data, and surveyed user opinions. A dataset that is larger and cleaner may provide different results.\n",

    "## E4: Recommended Action\n",
    "\n",
    "I would recommend that this model be used to evaluate patients in the hospital system, to predict if they have chronic back pain. While most patients will be identified correctly as having back pain (or not) when this is (or is not) the case, the group of interest will actually become those patients that the model predicts to have chronic back pain but lack a diagnosis of such. This group (the top right on our confusion matrix) is essentially being predicted to have chronic back pain and does not do so, and the fact that they don't when the model is generally correct may indicate that these patients are at risk of or likely to develop chronic back pain. Identifying these patients as being at-risk for such a malady creates an opportunity for preventative medicine and intervention to avoid or mitigate such an outcome and ensure that someone who \"should\" be in the chronic back pain group under this model remains out of it. While such interventions do cost more than doing nothing, avoiding such outcomes is likely to save money and other resources in the long run by avoiding necessary care for at-risk patients who later developing chronic back pain. As the adage goes, \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\". \n",
