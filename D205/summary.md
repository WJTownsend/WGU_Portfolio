# D205: Data Acquisition

## Course Summary

WGU states that D205 Data Acquisition builds proficiency in Structured Query Language (SQL) and the initial stages of the data analytics lifecycle. The course introduces relational databases. Students gain concrete skills in data transference and database manipulation.

This course has one Practical Assessment. 

## Course Objectives

WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Dimension, Quality Relations, and Limitations:** The graduate examines the data available for analysis to determine their dimension, quality, relations, and limitations.
- **Physical Data Models:** The graduate implements physical data models.
- **Table Operations:** The graduate performs table operations and queries within the context of data acquisition for analysis.

## Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files

This course has a single Practical Assessment. This project requires the student to access a virtual machine and use PostgreSQL and pgAdmin to import an external .csv file into an existing database as a new table, designing conceptual, logical, and physical models describing this. Once imported, the database must then be explored and queries generated of particular complexity to answer a research question developed by the student. 

My research question for this project was *“Are customers with children (or more children) more likely to purchase higher speed internet packages?”* This task could've been handled with a rather simple query, based on the data provided, but I elected to use a more complex query involving common table expressions and calculations in my final query to create more intuitively understandable results. [My report for this project, including the necessary SQL queries, can be viewed here.](https://github.com/WJTownsend/WGU_Portfolio/blob/main/D205/d205task1.pdf)

This task required a video presentation, demonstrating the successful operation of all code included in my report and covering certain aspects of the report. [That video can be seen here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19yLRrzJ96i_NpWQlTsuzKMgYfthdIJ9Z/view?usp=share_link).
