    "## A: Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "My research question is \"Does a relationship exist between readmission of patients and their having chronic back pain?\" This is a worthwhile question because one's wellness is often closely related to mobility. This relationship with wellness presumably extends towards one's ability to heal and recover after a hospital admission, and back pain can be a significant factor towards reducing one's mobility and thus their overall wellness. Discovering a relationship there can demonstrate a need to treat not only the issue that directly resulted in the patient's hospitalization but also their back pain to help reduce the likelihood that they are readmitted to the hospital. \n",

    "<a id='PartB'></a>\n",
    "## B: Description of Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains 52 separate columns, each containing a separate variable relating to a patient and their hospital admission. Each will be summarized here. \n",
    "\n",
    "- CaseOrder (quantitative), row 1 example: 1 <br>\n",
    "This column functions as an index included in the data, enforcing the ordering for all rows in the dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer_id (qualitative), row 1 example: C412403 <br>\n",
    "This column is an ID which uniquely identifies each patient. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interaction (qualitative), row 1 example: 8cd49b13-f45a-4b47-a2bd-173ffa932c2f <br>\n",
    "- UID (qualitative), row 1 example: 3a83ddb66e2ae73798bdf1d705dc0932 <br>\n",
    "These two columns are also IDs, which somehow uniquely identify information related to transactions, procedures, and admission for the patient record. It is unclear how these do so, though we can infer from their construction that they are not intended to be human-readable. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- City (qualitative), row 1 example: Eva <br>\n",
    "- State (qualitative), row 1 example: AL <br>\n",
    "- County (qualitative), row 1 example: Morgan <br>\n",
    "- Zip (qualitative), row 1 example: 35621 <br>\n",
    "- Lat (quantitative), row 1 example: 34.3496 <br>\n",
    "- Lng (quantitative), row 1 example: -86.7251 <br>\n",
    "These columns identify location data for the patient, including the city, state, county, zip code, and GPS coordinates, based on the billing statement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Population (quantitative), row 1 example: 2951 <br>\n",
    "- Area (qualitative), row 1 example: Suburban <br>\n",
    "Using census data for the patient's residence, this provides the population within a mile and whether that area is rural, suburban, or urban. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Timezone (qualitative), row 1 example: America/Chicago <br>\n",
    "This column provides the patient's timezone. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Job (qualitative), row 1 example: Psychologist, sport and exercise <br>\n",
    "Taken from admissions information, the data dictionary states that this is the job of the patient or primary insurance holder. It is unclear if there is any way to tell which is the case for any given patient. This also seems like it would be misleading, as \"job\" attached to a patient would imply that it's the patient's job, rather than their spouse, parent, or other caretaker's job. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Children (quantitative), row 1 example: 1 <br>\n",
    "Taken from admissions information, the data dictionary states that this reflects the number of children in the patient's household. This seems like it may be misleading, in that an intuitive reading of \"children\" without the data dictionary would generally be that this is the number of children the patient has, rather than the number of children the patient lives with. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age (quantitative), row 1 example: 53 <br>\n",
    "Taken from admissions information, this is the age of the patient. \n",

    "Taken from admissions information, this is the patient's current employment status. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Income (quantitative), row 1 example: 86575.93 <br>\n",
    "Taken from admissions information, the data dictionary states that this is the annual income of the patient or primary insurance holder. Again, it is unclear if there is any way to tell which is the case for any given patient. This again seems like it would be misleading, as \"income\" attached to a patient would imply that it's the patient's income, rather than their spouse, parent, or other caretaker's job. There are also some very real questions regarding why a hospital should even care about this (and some other related) data and whether or not that doesn't incentivize overtly capitalistic practices at the expense of patient care or other ethical concerns. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Marital (qualitative), row 1 example: Divorced <br>\n",
    "Taken from admissions information, the data dictionary states that this is the marital status of the patient or primary insurance holder. Again, it is unclear if there is any way to tell which is the case for any given patient. This again seems like it would be misleading, as \"marital status\" attached to a patient would imply that it's the patient's marital status, rather than their spouse, parent, or other caretaker's marital status.\n",

    "- Gender (qualitative), row 1 example: Male <br>\n",
    "Presumably taken from admissions information, this is the gender which the patient self-identifies as. The data dictionary stipulates that this is restricted only to male, female, or non-binary. \n",

    "A binary variable, this column indicates whether or not the patient is overweight for their particular height, gender, and age.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "This column notes the service provided to the patient during their hospitalization. The data dictionary restricts this only to blood work, intravenous, CT scan, and MRI. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initial_days (quantitative), row 1 example: 10.585770 <br>\n",
    "The number of days the patient was admitted to the hospital for during their initial visit is contained in this column. Judging by the precision of the floating point number, this seems to be calculated using hours and minutes, likely by timestamps for admission and release. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- TotalCharge (quantitative), row 1 example: 3191.048774 <br>\n",
    "This column provides the cost in USD charged to the patient for their care, daily. The data dictionary indicates that this is an average calculated based on a total charge (but only \"typical\" charges, not specialized treatments which a hospital might provide) divided by number of days hospitalized. This column seems abundantly misleading because it does not reflect a \"total charge\" by any intuitive meaning of the term, based both on the fact that it is a calculated daily average (not a total) and that it contains exclusions based on the type of care/service provided based on what is (or is not) \"typical\", despite the fact that a hospital deliberately provides a broad array of medical services. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Additional_charges (quantitative), row 1 example:17939.403420 <br>\n",
    "This column provides the cost in USD charged to the patient of the \"average amount... for miscellaneous procedures, treatments, medicines, anesthesiology, etc.\" The method for finding this average is undocumented in the data dictionary, though it could be reasonably assumed that it uses the same process as TotalCharge and again divides by the days hospitalized. Again, this column seems abundantly misleading because it does not reflect a total (the intuitive reading of \"additional charges\") and the seemingly arbitrary way in which it distinguishes a number of basic medical care options as \"non-typical\" by distinguishing these charges as separate from the \"typical\" charges in the TotalCharge column. \n",

    "## C1: Plan To Identify Data Anomalies\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify anomalies in the provided dataset, after importing the data from the CSV, I'll use the associated data dictionary and a cursory visual exploration of the table to identify any immediate problems that jump out to me. I can also use the datatypes returned by `info()` to make that the datatypes for each column are appropriate for the intended data within, as well as verifying if any null values exist within a given column. After looking at the table as a whole, I can then go through each column to examine the data within, including looking for data that is clearly incorrect or shouldn't exist, data that ought to be standardized, or data in the proper format for its intended usage. This will generally be done by using either the `value_counts()` or `describe()` functions, depending upon the column. Columns which should contain unique data (such as Customer_id) can be verified by appending the `count()` function to the results of `value_counts()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='PartC2'></a>\n",
    "## C2: Justification of Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "This plan approaches the data cleaning process from both a wider perspective in looking at the table as a whole, as well as a more narrow perspective in evaluating the data in each column. Using the data dictionary provided alongside the data set informs my assessments to make sure that they are handled consistently with the intended usage/business interest for each variable within the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `describe()` function will provide a summary of quantitative data, allowing me to identify what the data looks like through the description of its mean, standard deviation, and min/max.  \n",

    "<a id='PartC3'></a>\n",
    "## C3: Justify Programming Language/Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a simple but powerful programming language that easily allows for writing customized scripts to acquire, clean, and analyze data. The two primary packages that will be used to assist with this process are `numpy` and `pandas`. Numpy provides mathematical functions that may be necessary for transforming the data, and pandas provides a logical structure called a dataframe, which allows us to store the CSV in a similar format to a spreadsheet with functions to transform or standardize the data as needed. After the data is cleaned, a Principal Component Analysis will be performed, and this is going to make use of `PCA` from `SKlearn` to perform the analysis of principal components, as well as `seaborn` to graph any scree plots used as a part of this PCA. \n",

    "### Regarding Null Values in Children, Age, and Income\n",
    "- The columns Children, Age, and Income all contain numerous null values, evident in the fact that they do not contain 10,000 entries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any of these null values could be replaced. The Children and Income columns could reasonably have their null values replaced with either 0 or with values consistent with the mean for these columns, while age would likely be replaced with either a value of 18 (minors' ages appear to be omitted from the dataset) or with a mean for its column. Replacement of these presents problems in that it is altering what is presumably healthcare information about a patient (especially the Age column) with deliberately false information. Replacing this data inherently impacts the dataset and imposes my assumptions, complete with my own biases, over the entire dataset and misrepresenting it. This strikes me as bad data science at best, if not unethical. The inclusion of the Income column at all strikes me as **extremely unethical**, as patient/head of household income should not be a factor in any data analysis regarding the readmission of patients previously seen in a hospital, nor for any other consideration relating to the appropriate provision of care to these patients. Were I afforded the wherewithal to make decisions I myself, I would drop the column. The Performance Assessment Tips/Guide states that I am not to drop columns, so I will not do so. Notably, this unofficial guide makes no such prohibition on dropping rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rubric does **not** indicate that all null values must be replaced with a value (it is extremely vague on directions in general), and there are perfectly plausible reasons for a null value to exist. Data analysis can and often is performed on data sets which contain null values, and I do not find replacing these null values with other data to be a reasonable thing to do in this scenario, because it potentially negatively impacts the data. The rubric **does** require a Principal Component Analysis to be performed later on, and that particular requirement does require that my numeric data does not have an null values. As a such, I am instead choosing to drop all rows from the dataset which contain a null value in these three columns, performing my analysis on the remainder of the dataset. While I suspect that this is not the way the problem is necessarily *intended* to be solved, there are no directions precluding this solution and I believe that my solution is adequately supported by this rationale. \n",

    "To correct the zip codes which were incorrectly stored as integers, I will recast the column as a string, and then front-fill each cell with 0's to make sure all cells contain a string 5 digits long. \n",
    "\n",
    "To correct the timezones, a dictionary will be generated, equating each provided timezone (i.e. \"America/Detroit\") to a standard for their entire timezone (i.e. \"US - Eastern\"). A google search will be performed for each city to get the appropriate timezone, and the dictionary will be used to replace all current strings for timezone to the standardized timezones. The column will then be converted to category to prevent other incorrect/non-standard strings from being entered. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Age and Children columns, which need to be changed from floating points to integers, must also retain their `NaN` values. Recasting these columns to the default `int64` type will fail because of the NaN values, which ordinarily require the datatype to be float. The experimental `Int64` datatype in the pandas documentation is a new integer datatype, distinct from NumPy's `int64`, which allows these columns to be cast as integers while retaining support for `NaN` or null values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Gender column will replace the 'Male', 'Female', and 'Prefer not to answer' values with \"M\", \"F\", and \"NB\", consistent with the expectations provided in the data dictionary. The column will then be recast to categorical type. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Initial_days column will have all NaN values replaced with 0's. This is a reasonable assumption, because the column does not hold any values less than 1 (or even 1.00), implying that anyone who had a stay of less than 1 was simply registered as null. There is an argument to be made here whether it is more appropriate to round up (NaN -> 1, 1.5 -> 2, etc.) or truncate (NaN -> 0, 1.5 -> 1, etc.) or simply round to the nearest whole number. Given that this value likely stems from hours and minutes spent in the hospital, and 23 hours is apparently being \"rounded down\" to NaN/0, and having no direction to the contrary, I am presuming this is the most appropriate course of action for the business usage of this data and applying that assumption to the entire column. The column will then be recast to integer type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns identified as being more appropriate stored as strings, integers, or floats which would more appropriately be stored as categorical or boolean types will be recast in the appropriate datatype. This imposes certain integrity constraints on data added to the columns, provides for more efficient handling of the data, and facilitates data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The floating point columns with excessive precision values will be rounded to a more appropriate number of decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "The survey responses will be assigned a set of ordered categories representing the full range of survey scores, with \"1\" (\"most important\") being greater or \"higher\" than \"8\" (\"least important\"). Each column will then be cast as an ordered categorical datatype. \n",
    "\n",
    "The non-Pythonic and misleading/non-descriptive names will be corrected by renaming each column to be Pythonically and descriptively named. \n",

    "## D3: Summarize Outcomes of Cleaning Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The above operations will facilitate the future analysis of this data, as well as imposing constraints which help impose integrity of certain parts of the data when updated. For example, using the categorical or boolean datatypes restricts the potential values that can be input into the column, forcing a standardized entry. That standardization makes data analysis of that variable easier. An excellent example is seen with the timezone column, where analysis of patients by timezone is enhanced by having only the 9 timezones to break up the data, rather than having to 26 discrete \"timezones\" that we started with, many of which were actually the same timezome but with different labels. Reformatting of column headings will make future analysis easier by using standard conventions, preventing the process of having to look up the precise title of each column as I had to do throughout the project. \n",

    "\n",
    "The following limitations were noted during the data cleaning process:\n",
    "- I lack in-depth specialty knowledge to determine appropriate rounding of some floating point columns\n",
    "- Desired behavior for Initial_days is unclear\n",
    "- Gender column data of \"Prefer not to say\" may not necessarily reflect Non-Binary people\n",
    "- Categorical datatypes may not necessarily reflect all strings which it might be necessary for them to receive\n",
    "- The dataset was reduced in size by about 58%, to accommodate Principal Component Analysis (eliminate nulls)\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='PartD7'></a>\n",
    "## D7: Discussion of Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the lack of specialty knowledge to assess floating point columns, the column containing Vitamin D levels and the columns containing currency in USD both relied upon assumptions from myself. For the currency columns, nearly all usage of USD is done to two digits of precision (down to the cent). I applied this assumption without consideration for if there is a business necessity for the increased precision. With the Vitamin D levels, I lack domain knowledge to know exactly how precise those tests are, so I simply reduced the precision to 3 digits (still very precise, for the observed range) from 6. As my original research question was not concerned with these variables, this should not have any impact on an analysis concentrated on answering this question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the behavior of Initial_days, as addressed in section D2, the presentation of days spent in the hospital as a floating point number is unusual and seems unintuitive. While we might say \"I spent two and a half days in the hospital\", the precision of measuring and presenting this down to the second is misleading and potentially problematic. Similarly, whether it would be better for the business to round down/truncate (handling the discrete days and ignoring the hours) or to round up (a bed occupied for x hours is actually occupied for x + y hours, where y reflects related operations such as cleaning, sterilization, etc.) is completely unclear within the project's data dictionary. As a result, I had to infer which would be most appropriate from the remaining data. However, lacking domain knowledge, the assumption I made (truncation of data after the decimal point) may be incorrect. As my original research question was not concerned with these variables, this should not have any impact on an analysis concentrated on answering this question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the gender column, three values were encountered: \"Male\", \"Female\", and \"Prefer not to say\". The data dictionary indicated that the outcome should be \"Male\", \"Female\", and \"Non-Binary\", which implies that \"Prefer not to say\" should equate to \"Non-Binary\". However, this is not necessarily a sound assumption on which to operate. While non-binary people may choose a \"Prefer not to say\" option because their gender is not reflected by the options provided, privacy is also a reason why people might choose this option. In this situation, people simply choosing to exercise reasonable privacy would instead be identified as non-binary. In addition to being inaccurate, this potentially opens up these individuals to harm in an era in which the LGBTQ community is dealing with targeted harassment and violence as a result of political polarization within the United States. As my original research question was not concerned with these variables, this should not have any impact on an analysis concentrated on answering this question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the categorical datatypes, I am limited by the data provided here to generate the categories for each column. If the original dataset itself of 10,000 entries does not actually reflect all of the desired strings that may be entered in a particular field, then the casting of columns as categorical using the data provided thus far will prevent the input of that desired string until the column's categories are updated. As my original research question was not concerned with these variables, this should not have any impact on an analysis concentrated on answering this question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the dataset itself was made smaller as a result of my decision (outlined above) to eliminate all rows containing null values in the children, age, and income columns. This took the dataset from 10,000 entries to 4,221. This is still a large number of datapoints and worth exploring, as I have continued to do through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), but it bear mentioning that the dataset is smaller as a result. This will generally increase the standard deviation of numeric columns because there are fewer values \"anchoring\" the mean, and it may result in the mean moving slightly as well if the eliminated data was for some reason not indicative of the rest of the population. As it pertains to this research question, the categorical nature of the variables needed makes these less of a concern, especially given the number of results still in play at this point. \n",

PCA requires quantifiable numeric data, and these variables represent all of the quantitative variables available in the dataset. \n",

    "The above graph clearly shows that the first five principal components have a eigenvalue greater than 1. The sixth principal component is tough to see in relation to the red line at a value of 1, but printing the array of eigenvalues which was graphed shows that the sixth component is slightly above 1 and should thus be retained. Components 7 through 13 all have eigenvalues below 1, so they are discarded. \n",

    "Across a dataset with numerous variables, Principal Component Analysis lets us break these down into fewer dimensions, with each one representing a number of \"like\" variables (Towards Data Science, 2017). PCA does require quantitative variables, which there are relatively few of in this data, and those variables to have a relationship with each other. In this dataset, the days spent in hospital, the total charges, and the additional charges can all be understood to have a relationship with each other, as they are all measures which can be understood to relate to \"severity of initial complaint\" because a more serious problem *generally* requires a longer hospitalization and more involved (and expensive) care. Rather than testing each of these variables against readmission, PCA combines these variables (and others) into a single element which can then be tested against readmission. Depending on the nature of the analysis performed and the variables available, this could be expanded to include several other variables, too. In this way, rather than testing every variable against readmission, we can instead test much fewer variables.  \n",
